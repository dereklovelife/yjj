% Solving Sum-throughput optimization by using SCA approach.


% Nt : Numbers of anteenas at the transmitter.
% k: Numbers of users.
% alpha: path-loss factor.
% Data: throughput requirement in the DL transmission.
% Functions required :
% 1. SumOptimization, solve the sum throughput with beamforming fixed.
% 2. MaxBeam, solve the sum throughput with time-slots and PS factors fixed.
